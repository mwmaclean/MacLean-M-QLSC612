# Contributors : Mich√®le MacLean

# This exercise is part of the BrainHack QLSC6112 course and was designed to demonstrate how researchers can (easily) produce false positives or inflated prediction rates via p-hacking.


## Getting Started
Steps to install the necessary dependencies 
These following will allow you to get a copy of the workflow up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
